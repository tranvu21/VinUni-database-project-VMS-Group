## ðŸ“„ Project Description

The **University Activity Management System (UAMS)** is designed to help colleges and universities manage various academic and administrative activities. The system allows users with different roles, such as students, professors, and staff, to interact with the database based on their access rights. 

Key functionalities include:
- **Student Access**: Register for courses in a given semester, view grades, GPA, and academic history.
- **Professor/Staff Access**: View schedules, salary information, and other relevant administrative data.
- **Administrative Functions**: Manage department and course data, assign professors to courses, and monitor student registrations.

The system aims to improve the efficiency of academic management and provide easy access to academic records for students and staff, fostering better communication and resource allocation within the university.
